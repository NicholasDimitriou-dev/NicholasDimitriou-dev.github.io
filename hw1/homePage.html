                        In computer science many algorithms were made for the sake of efficiency. By making a more time efficient method a developer can make their 
                        website make more calls and store more data. But that's not what I want to talk about today. Today I wish to talk about the <b>inefficient</b> 
                        sorting methods. The ones that <b>don't</b> work, the ones that do and why they <b>shouldn't</b> be implemented. There are many different ways to sort 
                        an array. If one wanted to they could make a new one now it is very simple. Just take one of the three sins of bad sorting algorithms.
                        <b>The three sins of bad sorting algorithms</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Packet/information loss</li>
                            <li> Time complexity is too high</li>
                            <li> Never actually sorts</li>
                        </ol>
                        You may ask what benefit we get from making inefficient sorting methods. Well it's quite simple. By making a sorting method inefficient it 
                        shows a deep understanding of how sorting methods work because to make something work intentionally bad one must understand how it is good.
