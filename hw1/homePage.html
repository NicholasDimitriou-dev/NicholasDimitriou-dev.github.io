                        In computer science many algorthims were made for the sake of effeciency. By making a more time effiencet method a devolper can 
                        make their website make more calls and store more data. But thats not what I want to talk about today. Today I wish to talk about 
                        the <b>ineffencent</b> sorting methods. The ones that dont work the ones that do and why they shouldn't be implmented. There are many 
                        differnet ways to sort an array. If one wanted to they could make a new one now it is very simple. Just take one of the three sins of
                         bad sorting algorithms
                    </p>

                            <li> Packet/information loss</li>
                            <li> Time complexisty is too high</li>
                            <li> Never actually sorts</li>
                        </ol>

                        You may ask what benift do we get from making innefiecent sorting methods. Well its quite simple by making a sorting method ineffencent it shows a
                        deep undernstanding of how sorting methods work becuase to make something work intontionally bad one must understand how it is good.
