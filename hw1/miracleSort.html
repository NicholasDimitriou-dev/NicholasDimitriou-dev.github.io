                    Miracle Sort is a sorting method that can refer to two very similar but sorting methods. Miracle sort at its 
                    inception was a method that asked what is the least amount of computation i can do for a sorting method and 
                    what was found is either a basic search algorithm or 1 line of code. Miracle Sort is exactly what it says on 
                    the tin, a sorting method that just never does anything and hopes for a miracle. To this day no miracle sort 
                    has been completed so its official Big O notation is O(infinity). One implementation returns the array back 
                    and asserts it is already sorted while the other periodically checks to see if the array has been sorted. 
                    Whether or not this sorting method is valid is not one I can answer. One can only hope theology will be able
                     to solve this conundrum but as it stands I believe this to be the worst sorting method available.
